# Covid-19-Detection-Using-DeepLearning
Diagnosing Covid using Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning techniques  

Given X-ray images of patients, the task is to build a machine learning model that detects whether a patient has COVID-19 (target value 1) or is Non-COVID (target value 0).
An AI and Deep Learning solution to assist in diagnosing Covid-19 infection through the analysis of chest X-Ray images.
## __DATASET DESCRIPTION__  
The dataset utilized in this study is a compilation of several sources, from which the NORMAL and COVID-19 INFECTED chest X-Ray images have been extracted.
